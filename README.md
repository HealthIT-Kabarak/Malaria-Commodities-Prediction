## 1.1: Problem Statement
The restocking of Malaria commodities is currently done based on 6 month averages computed by MoH officials from the KHIS system data. These averages do not paint a clear picture of trends related to consumption such as seasonality, increases or decreases as well as other confounding factors.

## 1.2: Model to Design:
  To develop a commodity demand prediction model based on historical data for use in restocking decision making.
  
## 1.3 Installation
  
  ### 1.3.1: CLoning the Project
      git clone https://github.com/HealthIT-Kabarak/Malaria-Commodities-Restocking-Prediction-Model.git
      
  ### 1.3. 2: Install necessary packages for this project
      pip install <package-name>
      
## 1.4 Challanges faced
    - There was a lot of consistency and redundancy and missing rows and this borrowed a lot of time in us data cleaning and feature engineering.
    - The inconsistency in data made to difficult in us find an algorithm that could help in our model development.
